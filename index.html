            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Highs and lows are a part of life, and life must go on. To keep our Ilves going on, we need certain
                conflicts and issues unaddressed These issues remain under the surface until they all pile up and become
                a mountain that then starts trying to rupture out emotional skin and break out. At such moments, people
                usually get puzzled and can't make sense of what is happening to them as they lose track of the past
                issues. It does not represent any emotional weakness or mental instability. It is noturo and hoppens to
                everybody Sometimes, tolking with your close friends and family members helps suppress the asues and
                give you a break until they break out again. And sometimes, it is just not enough. That is when you need
                professional help like the one we offer. It would help if you had an environment where you can talk to
                somebody who listens, understands and can propose solutions in a non- judgmental and private manner.
